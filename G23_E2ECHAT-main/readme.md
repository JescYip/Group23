## End-to-end encrypted chat web application

```
Semester 2, 2023/
```

Nowadays, web services are the mostcommon form of applications that users areexposed to. Web browsers become the mostpopular application on a computer thatenables users to access those web services.Ensuring the security of web services isessential for the Internet. Moreover, privacyof communications is an important feature ofmodern times. Your job is to implement anend-to -end encrypted chat web applicationand secure various aspects of the website.

## Overview


### Objectives

1. Adapt a basic chat web application to become a secure E2EE chat web app
2. Comply with some of the requirements in NIST Special Publication 800-63B ‚ÄúDigital Identity Guidelines ‚Äì Authentication and Lifecycle Management‚Äù for US federal agencies (which is also a reference for other types of systems)
3. Implement a secure MFA mechanism based on passwords and OTP (or FIDO2)
4. Encrypt communications between two users so that the server does not know the content of the messages (E2E encryption) 
5. Protect communications in transit by configuring a modern TLS deployment
6. Package a docker image of your web app

## Requirements (authentication)

1. From NIST Special Publication 800-63B:
    **1. Comply with all** **_SHALL_** **and** **_SHOULD_** **requirements** from sections listed below
2. Use the following authenticators:
    - User-chosen Memorized Secret (i.e., password/passphrase)
    - and Single-Factor OTP Device (e.g., Google Authenticator)
        - orSingle-Factor Cryptographic Device (e.g., Yubikey) if you have one
    - and Look-Up Secrets (recovery keys)
    - Comply with related requirements in ¬ß5.1and ¬ß4.2.
        - ¬ß5.1.1.2: ‚ÄúMemorized secrets SHALL be salted and hashed using a suitable one-way key
            derivation function‚Äù
            - See our Password Security lecture for an appropriate function
        - MemorizedSecret Verifiers(¬ß5.1.1.2)
            - Choose ‚ÄúPasswords obtained from previous breach corpuses‚Äù and refer to
            https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#PwnedPasswordsfor the corpus to check against
        - ¬ß5.2.8 and ¬ß5.2.9are automatically complied


## Requirements (authentication)

1. From NIST Special Publication 800-63B:
3. ¬ß5.2.2: Implement rate-limiting mechanisms AND image-based CAPTCHAs
4. Implement new account registration and bind authenticators (OTP/Yubikeyand recovery keys) at the same time
        - Optional: provide a way to change authenticators after account registration
5. ¬ß7.1: Implement proper session binding requirements
6. Exceptions:
    - OTP authenticators ‚Äîparticularly software-based OTP generators ‚ÄîSHOULD discourage and
        SHALL NOT facilitate the cloning of the secret key onto multiple devices.
            - Google Authenticator and related apps are OK


## Requirements (E2EE chat)

2. Once users are logged in, secure chat messages between two users in a way so that the server cannot decrypt the messages

1. Use the **ECDH key exchange** protocol to establish a shared secret between two users
    - Leverage the **WebCrypto API** , see demo https://webkit.org/demos/webcrypto/ecdh.html
    - Exchanged information during the key exchange can be sent through the server
        - The server is trusted not to modify messages of the key exchange
    - Choose **P-384** as the underlying curve
**2. Derive two 256-bit AES-GCM encryption keys** and **two 256-bit MAC keys** from the shared secret
    using **HKDF-SHA**
        - One key for encryption between user1 to user2, and another one from user2 to user
        - Using WebCrypto API again, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
            US/docs/Web/API/HkdfParams
        - The **salt** should be unique so another key derivation in the future produces different keys, use
            for instance a counter starting at 1
        - The **info** parameter should represent the current context (e.g., ‚ÄúCHAT_KEY_USER1to2‚Äù for the
            key for user1ÔÉ†user2, and‚ÄúCHAT_MAC_USER1to2‚Äù for the MAC key for user1ÔÉ†user2)


## Requirements (E2EE chat)

2. Once users are logged in, secure chat messages between two users in a way so that the server cannot decrypt the messages

    3. Messages will be encrypted using **AES in GCM mode**
       - 96-bit IVs are **counters** representing the number of messages encrypted with the same key
          - Note: GCM does not require unpredictable IVs, but unique IVs
       - Send the IV together with the ciphertext to the recipient
       - As a recipient, verify that IVùëñùëñ > IVùëñùëñ‚àí1to prevent replay attacks
       - Protect the IV with **HMAC-SHA256** using the derived MAC key to prevent the attacker from choosing IVs
       - **Associated data** should reflect the current context (e.g‚ÄúCHAT_MSG_USER1to2‚Äù)
       - Authentication tags should be 128 bits
    4. Store all key material in the HTML5 Local Storage of the browser to be retrieved after the browser is reopened
    5. Display the history of previous messages being exchanged + new messages
       - If Local Storage has been cleared, previous messages cannot be decrypted, show warning


## Requirements (E2EE chat)

2. Once users are logged in, secure chat messages between two users in a way so that the server cannot decrypt the messages

    6. All symmetric keys and IVs should be **re-derived** from the shared secret when **user clicks on a**
       **‚ÄúRefresh‚Äù button** in the chat (not the browser refresh button), using a new salt
          - The participant that requests a change should inform the other party with a special message
             composed of the last IV that has been used, the string ‚Äúchange‚Äù, altogether protected with
             the **old MAC key** AND the **new MAC key**
             - Two different MACs over the message
             - The other party should verify the old MAC before processing the message, then derive
                new keys and verify again the new MAC before accepting the new keys
          - Both parties should show a message ‚Äú **Keys changed** ‚Äù in the chat history
          - **Old keys should be kept** to decrypt older messages when the browser is reopened, you
             should identify which set of keys to use for a given message based on the preceding values
             sent during the key exchange (i.e., keep track of user public keys)
             - Key exchange messages older than a minute should not be considered as a fresh key
                exchange to engaged into


## Requirements (E2EE chat)

2. Once users are logged in, secure chat messages between two users in a way so that the server cannot decrypt the messages

    7. When the Local Storage is cleared, or when there is no shared secret for a given recipient, the sender should initiate the ECDH key exchange using a special message and the recipient should engage in the key exchange even when there had been a shared secret previously established
    8. Chat messages should be encoded using **UTF-8** , and network messages between users should be formatted in **JSON** using your own schema (e.g., {‚Äútype‚Äù:‚ÄùECDH‚Äù, ‚Äúkey‚Äù:‚Äù...‚Äù}, {‚Äútype‚Äù:‚Äùmsg‚Äù, ‚Äúciphertext‚Äù:‚Äù...‚Äù, ‚ÄúIV‚Äù:‚Äù...‚Äù, ‚ÄúMAC‚Äù:‚Äù...‚Äù})
    9. Use console.log() to **log all crypto operations** (including key, IV, plaintext, etc.)
       - It should be visually obvious that IVs are not reused, keys change when needed (see next requirements), etc.
    10. The chat app should be protected against cross-site request forgery (**CSRF**), cross-site scripting (**XSS**), and **SQL injection** attacks


## Requirements (TLS)

3. Communications should be encrypted in transit using TLS with the following configuration:

    - Reuse Mozilla‚Äôs ‚Äúmodern‚Äù configuration for nginx, and change it as needed:
       - https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/
    1. TLS version 1.3 only
    2. x25519 Elliptic Curve Group only
    3. TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 cipher suite only
    4. No OCSP stappling (since you will use a self-signed CA certificate)
    5. HSTS for one week
    6. TLS certificate requirements:
       1. X.509 version 3
       2. ECDSA public key over P-
       3. SHA384 as hashing algorithm for signature
       4. CA flag (critical): false
       5. Key Usage (critical) = Digital Signature
       6. Extended Key Usage = Server Authentication
       7. Include both Subject Key Identifier and Authority Key Identifier
       8. Validity period = 90 days


## Requirements (TLS)

3. Communications should be encrypted in transit using TLS with the following configuration:

    7. The website should be hosted at
       https://group-[your-group-number].comp3334.xavier2dc.fr:8443/
       - Group #10 will be at group-10.comp3334.xavier2dc.fr
    8. All subdomains *.comp3334.xavier2dc.fr will redirect to 127.0.0.
       - You can effectively use ‚Äúgroup-X.comp3334.xavier2dc.fr‚Äù instead of ‚Äúlocalhost‚Äù
       - If you do not host the docker container on localhost,
          add a manual entry in your hosts file
          - Linux: /etc/hosts
          - Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
    9. Issue the certificate from the given CA certificate and private key**
       - Use the domain name corresponding to your group
       - Domain should appear as both **Common Name** and **Subject Alternative Name**
    10. The CA certificate is domain-constrained to subdomains of comp3334.xavier2dc.fr, meaning you can safely trust it on your computer (nobody can generate valid certificates for other domains)



## Simple Chat Demo

1. Deploy the docker container using the following line within the folder that contains the docker-
    compose.yamlfile:
       $ sudodocker-compose up -d
2. So far, the chat app works over plain HTTP on port 8080, access it at:
    [http://group-0.comp3334.xavier2dc.fr:](http://group-0.comp3334.xavier2dc.fr:)
3. Open a new private window of your browser and access the website again
    1. Chrome:
    2. Firefox:
4. Login as Alice (password: password123) on the first window
5. Login as Bob (password: password456) on the second (private) window
6. Select Bob as contact from Alice‚Äôs chat, select Alice as contact from Bob‚Äôs chat
7. Send messages each other!
8. When modifying the server-side (app.py) or client-side (login.html, chat.html), simply restart the docker container, you do not need to rebuild the container:
       ```$ sudodocker restart [you-container-name]-webapp- 1```

## FAQ

#### 1. Can I use a library?

Depends, does it replace the whole chat protocol with a better and secure chat?

#### Then, no. You still need to implement a secure chat protocol.

Does the library implement part of the requirements (e.g., proper session management, OTP, hashing algorithm, etc.)? Then, yes.

2. How can I rebuild the docker container if I need to modify, say, the nginx config?

    1. docker-compose down -v
    2. docker-compose build --no-cache
    3. docker-compose up -d
    3. How can I debug errors?
    - docker logs [your-container]


## FAQ

#### 4. How does the web chat application work?

1. It is written in Python using Flask
2. It is running behind the WSGI server Gunicorn
3. Which is running behind the reverse proxy nginx(which should provide TLS)
4. The front-end is written in HTML and Javascript
5. The server app writes messages into a MySQL database
